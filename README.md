I am a student at Tarsus University Management Information Systems department.
I have good command of 21st century skills and skilled in leadership,
communication and risk analysis skills. I am assertive and open-minded.
I analyze important details in projects
and in-group strategic decisions from many different aspects and I do this in a short time.
Due to my interest in software and management and the relationship my department has with these
fields, I am looking for various internship and talent program opportunities.
